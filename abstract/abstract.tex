\begin{abstract}
With the increasing surveillance efforts on the Internet by various governments,
the demand\slash need for privacy has also escalated. PGP empowers people to
take their privacy in their own hands. It provides security services for
electronic communication and data storage using a combination of strong
public-key and symmetric cryptography. These services include confidentiality,
key management, authentication, and digital signatures.

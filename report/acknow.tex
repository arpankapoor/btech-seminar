I would like to acknowledge the help and guidance received from several people
in preparation of this report.

First and foremost, I would like to thank the course coordinators Lijiya A,
Sameer Mohamed Thahir, Vinith R and Ibrahim A for helping us choose an
appropriate topic for the seminar.

I would like to thank Dr.~Vinod Pathari for his Computer Security course, which
spurred my interest in that domain.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their continual
support in all my endeavours.

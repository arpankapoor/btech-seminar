Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows a client to encrypt its data in
such a way that this data can still be searched. The most immediate application
of SSE is to cloud storage, where it enables a client to securely outsource its
data to an untrusted cloud provider without sacrificing the ability to search
over it.

A practical SSE scheme should (at a minimum) satisfy the following properties:
sublinear search time, security against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks,
compact indexes and the ability to add and delete files efficiently.
A SSE scheme to satisfy all the properties outlined above is discussed.
